# Wrap up

```{r pipeline, echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/data_science_pipeline.png")
```



# Mock Exam

# Q&A

## Review of binary/hexadecimal system

Microprocessors can only represent two signs (states): 

 - 'Off' = `0`
 - 'On' = `1`

```{r onoff, echo=FALSE, out.width = "10%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/on_off.png")
```


## The binary counting frame

- Only two signs: `0`, `1`.
- Base 2.
- Columns: $2^0=1$, $2^1=2$, $2^2=4$, and so forth.

## Conversion between binary/decimal

- Draw a binary counting frame/table
- Columns from right to left: $2^0=1$, $2^1=2$, $2^2=4$, and so forth.
- Fill in the respective binary values (`0` or `1`) in each column.
  - Binary to decimal: simply fill in the values starting with the right-most column/digit.
  - Decimal to binary: select largest column value that is smaller than (or equal to) the decimal number. Then fill up the remaining columns.
- (Same approach for hexadecimal/decimal etc.)

## Example: Conversion from binary to decimal

- What is `1101` in decimal?

$2^n$ | ... | $2^7$ | $2^6$| $2^5$ | $2^4$| $2^3$  | $2^2$  | $2^1$  |  $2^0$ 
----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
$2^n$ | ... | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8  | 4  | 2  |  1 

## Example: Conversion from binary to decimal

- What is `1101` in decimal?

$2^n$ | ... | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8  | 4  | 2  |  1 
----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|


## Example: Conversion from binary to decimal

- What is `1101` in decimal?

$2^n$ | ... | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8  | 4  | 2  |  1 
----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| | | | | | | 1|1|0|1|


## Example: Conversion from binary to decimal

- What is `1101` in decimal?

$2^n$ | ... | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8  | 4  | 2  |  1 
----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| | | | | | | 1|1|0|1|

- Solution:
$$(1 \times 8) + (1 \times 4) + (0 \times 2) + (1 \times 1) = 13.$$


## Example: Conversion from decimal to binary

What is the decimal number *139* in binary?


## Example: Conversion from decimal to binary

What is the decimal number *139* in binary?
 
 - Solution:
 
$$(1 \times 2^7) + (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 139.$$



## Example: Conversion from decimal to binary

What is the decimal number *139* in binary?
 
 - Solution:
 
$$(1 \times 2^7) + (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 139.$$

  - More precisely:
  
$$(1 \times 2^7) + (0 \times 2^6) +  (0 \times 2^5) +  (0 \times 2^4) + (1 \times 2^3)\\ + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) +  (1 \times 2^0)  = 139.$$

  - That is, the number `139` in the decimal system corresponds to `10001011` in the binary system.



## The hexadecimal system

- *16 symbols*: 
    - `0`-`9` (used like in the decimal system)...
    - and `A`-`F` (for the numbers 10 to 15).
  
- *16 symbols >>> base 16*: each digit represents an increasing power of 16 ($16^{0}$, $16^{1}$, etc.).



## The hexadecimal system

What is the decimal number 139 expressed in the hexadecimal system?

- Solution: 
$$(8\times 16^1) +  (11\times 16^0) = 139.$$



# Course Evaluation

## Course Evaluation: Summary

## Course Evaluation: Open Feedback
<center>
*Thanks a lot!*
</center>

## Positive Points
- Lecture notes/lecture materials
- Practical examples during lectures/exercises

## Negative Points/Room for Improvement
- Why multiple choice examination and not students project?
- Exercises format (more, smaller groups, rooms)
- Lecture slides


## Course Evaluation: Open Feedback

*"Which aspects of this course should be changed so that future students can profit more from it?"*

- Tutorial sessions üëç
- More ex(smaller) ercise sessions üëç
- Still 'elective course format' (not 'mandatory course format') üëç
- Assignments that count towards the grade üëç

## Course Evaluation: Open Feedback

*"Which aspects of this course should be changed so that future students can profit more from it?"*

- Tutorial sessions üëç
- More (smaller) exercise sessions üëç
- Still 'elective course format' (not 'mandatory course format') üëç
- Assignments that count towards the grade üëç
- Challenge: Resources! üéÉ


## Course Evaluation: Open Feedback

*"Which aspects of this course should be changed so that future students can profit more from it?"*

- More basics, less topics
- More topics
- Challenge: Very heterogenous group (mandatory course) üéÉ

## Course Evaluation: Food for thought

- Expectations regarding specific evaluation criteria.
 - Goals of the lecture
 - Exam preparation
 - Exercises vs exercises that are graded
 - Responsibilities of lecturers and students


## Course Evaluation: Food for thought

- Expectations regarding specific evaluation criteria.
 - Goals of the lecture
 - Exam preparation
 - Exercises vs exercises that are graded
 - Responsibilities of lecturers and students

- Problematic incentives for the lecturer (at least if (s)he is an economist...). üéÉ



## Course Evaluation: Food for thought

- Ask yourself early on what *you* can do to improve the situation!
- Do not forget to think for yourself!



## My Feedback to You

- By and large attentive, focused (still room for improvement)
- Good questions


## My Feedback to You

- Exploit learning by doing!
- Engage more in class!
- Think about what YOU can do to deal with the fact that this is a large lecture!


# Improvements


## Improvements 
- *Course structure*
  - Each slide set/lecture note will at the beginning explicitly mention the learning goals.
  - Online tutorials
  - Split exercises/exercise sessions into 'more comfortable'/'less comfortable'

## Improvements 
- *Infrastructure*
    - (Cloud solution for exercises)
- *Examination*
    - (Examination: Written Exam (80%), Group project (20%))

<!-- ## Improvements  -->

<!-- - *Examination* -->
<!--     - Exam: part multiple choice, part open questions -->
<!--     - (Examination: Written Exam (80%), Group project (20%)) -->
<!-- - *Other*  -->
<!--     - Guest lecture: case study with material (some prep work for students) -->


<!-- ## Improvements -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- *Aim: *  -->
<!-- *Become the reference introductory course on data science in undergraduate econ.* -->
