# define three variables each with the value 1/3
a <- 1/3
b <- 1/3
c <- 1/3

# use those variables to compute 2/3 in different ways
# 1)
1 - a
# 2)
b + c

# from looking at the definition of a, b, and c 
# 1) and 2) must be mathematically identical
# after all 2/3 = 2/3...

# However
(1-a) == (b+c)
(1-a) - (b+c)
